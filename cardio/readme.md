## Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Dataset (The 2021 BRFSS Dataset from CDC)
Instruction: Extract the zip file for the dataset

In this notebook, I wanted to know if the prognosis and current lifestyle status affect the person's General Health.
Using a classification algorithm (Random Forest), I will determine how the model interprets it.

After feeding the model with the data and keeping only the necessary data, there were several things that greatly influenced one's general health.
The model achieved 95% accuracy in the 80-20 ratio for training and testing, respectfully. The ratio is kept at a level as the data that was used is quality grade.
