My work for THESIS2

The dataset used here is temporary. Datasets for this project will be acquired by simulating the LFI attacks in different virtual machines such as Mutillidale II, DVWA, and Metasploitable. 

To tune the algorithm for the dataset, we are going to find the best parameter using RandomizedSearchCV and determine the performance of the created model in detecting Local File Inclusion

The algorithm will be implemented to classify whether there is an attack or not. By splitting the dataset into 80/20 ratio for training and testing respectfully, the randomized value is to be set at default of 42.

The model will also produce results on which network segments are affected the most by LFI.
